    <p>Modern recommender systems rely on black-box machine learning models to predict consumer choices. However, because these models do not explicitly represent the underlying data-generating process (DGP), they often struggle to generalize beyond observed data. A growing body of work advocates for incorporating consumer intent into personalization systems to improve generalization.</p>
<p>Yet in the context of <strong>landing page recommendations</strong>—the most common and challenging personalization setting—a <strong>list</strong> of recommendations must be generated immediately when a consumer enters the platform, <em>before</em> any explicit intent signal is available.</p>
<p>We propose the <em>Intent-Structured Landing-Page Recommender System (ISRec)</em>, a principled framework that incorporates intent-based structure into multi-stage landing page recommender systems <em>without</em> requiring explicit consumer input and while satisfying industrial latency constraints. ISRec defines intent as a consumer's dynamic <em>receptiveness</em> to subsets of content, allowing intent labels to be inferred directly from observed behavior.</p>
<p>It consists of three stages: intent prediction, intent-aware reward modeling, and intent-aware whole-page optimization, serving as the <em>optimal</em> greedy solution to the original NP-hard intent-aware recommendation problem with provable regret-bound guarantees.</p>
<p>We evaluate ISRec on YouTube, the world's largest video recommendation platform, and find that it significantly improves daily active users (DAU) by 0.05% and overall user enjoyment by 0.09%, among the largest business metric gains observed in recent YouTube experiments, corresponding to an estimated $32.5 million in annual ads revenue.</p>
<p>Our findings provide empirical evidence that even without knowing the true DGP, enforcing a partial structure aligned with it can help the model generalize. Managerially, ISRec offers a principled and generalizable framework for integrating behavioral and structural insights into real-time industrial personalization systems, paving the way for human-in-the-loop AI design.</p>
