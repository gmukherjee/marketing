  <div class="abstract-text">
    <p>A common assumption in the fitting of unordered multinomial response models for J mutually exclusive categories is that the responses arise from the same set of J categories across subjects. However, when responses measure a choice made by the subject, it is more appropriate to condition the distribution of multinomial responses on a subject-specific consideration set, drawn from the power set of {1,2,...,J}. This leads to a mixture of multinomial response models governed by a probability distribution over the J* = 2^J - 1 consideration sets.</p>
<p>We introduce a novel method for estimating such generalized multinomial response models based on the fundamental result that any mass distribution over J* consideration sets can be represented as a mixture of products of J component specific inclusion-exclusion probabilities. Moreover, under time-invariant consideration sets, the conditional posterior distribution of consideration sets is sparse. These features enable a scalable MCMC algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution of parameters, random effects, and consideration sets.</p>
<p>Under regularity conditions, the posterior distributions of the marginal response probabilities and the model parameters satisfy consistency. The methodology is demonstrated in a longitudinal data set on weekly cereal purchases that cover J = 101 brands, a dimension substantially beyond the reach of existing methods.</p>
